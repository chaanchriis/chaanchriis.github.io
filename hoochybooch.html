          During initial meetings with Hoochy 'Booch where we explained the
          possibilities of our project scope, we were able to gather that their
          main goals in working with us were to increase sales and
          subscriptions, ultimately leading to greater brand exposure and
          customer loyalty.

          Keeping the business objectives of the company in mind, the goal was
          to investigate all dimensions of usability that directly relate to the
          browsing and purchasing experience. Through a combination of Usability
          Testing, Heuristic Evaluation, and Pre- and Post-Test Questionnaires,
          we sought to collect data that would help answer the following
          research questions:

          Evaluation methods employed included heuristic evaluations, pre and

        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <div class="colContainer">
          <p>
            Each testing session was conducted by two team members — one would
            lead the session and one would take notes (See "User Testing over
            Zoom" above). Prior to their respective session, participants
            completed the consent form and Pre-Test Questionnaire. During the
            session, participants were asked to share their screens and were
            encouraged to think aloud while they performed three tasks. Each
            session was video-recorded with prior consent.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h5>Task One: Unstructured browsing</h5>
            <p>
              Participants were presented with the Hoochy 'Booch home page and
              given five minutes to browse the site as if it were their first
              time visiting. This task was not structured and was intended to
              inform us of how users browse, what things on the page catch their
              eye and their first impressions. Follow-up questions were asked,
              depending on the content that was explored and the comments that
              were made. E.g. “Based on what you’ve seen while browsing, what
              types of products appear to be offered?”, “What kinds of products
              have you tried or would you try, and why?” etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              In tasks two and three, participants were given a short scenario
              and asked to think aloud while navigating the site to complete the
              task, making sure to give details on what they thought, how they
              felt, or what the expected to happen. These tasks were designed
              around two of the company's main goals, improving the browsing and
              purchasing process, and to jumpstart their kombucha subcription
              model.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Task Two: Kombucha for a party</h5>
            <p>
              “You’re planning a Christmas party. You have 20 guests coming over
              and you want to purchase some kombucha for your guests. Browse the
              site and finish the task by adding the product(s) to the cart and
              checking out.”
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Task Three: Kombucha subscriptions</h5>
            <p>
              “You’re a die-hard 'booch fan; you love drinking kombucha daily.
              You’re looking for a way to keep your fridge stocked without
              having to go out each week. Please browse the site and finish the
              task by adding product(s) to the cart and checking out.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Post-test</h5>
            <p>
              After completing the three tasks, participants were asked a series
              of questions about their overall experience with the site, as well
              as their thoughts about any improvements or issues they would like
              to see addressed. A Post-Test Questionnaire was also completed
              after the session.
            </p>

        <h3>Reliability and Validity of Data</h3>

        <div class="colContainer">
          <p>
            We used a couple different research techniques to ensure our data
            was as reliable as possible.

          <div>
            <h5>Method Triangulation</h5>
            <p>
              Involving all of our different evaluation methods, was used to
              study the situation through multiple lenses and broaden our
              insight into the underlying usability issues Hoochy 'Booch’s
              website faces. Insights were established based on the converging
              of these methods to improve validity.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Investigator Triangulation</h5>
            <p>
              Employed by using multiple researchers (the five members of our
              team) to analyze, interpret, and cross-check findings to mitigate
              the risk of observer bias.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Use of Rich, Thick Descriptions</h5>
            <p>
              All notes were inscribed with a high degree of detail, using
              direct participant quotes, and descriptions of how participants
              behaved. The team withheld from making interpretations of the data
              during the testing session, noting them down as is.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>External Validity</h5>
            <p>
              Ensured through the recruitment of appropriate target users and
              the usage of realistic tasks that are representative of the
              product's intentions.

          Methods we used to analyze our collected data included affinity
          diagramming, analysis of descriptive statistics, and group discussions

            <h5>Affinity Diagramming</h5>
            <p>
              Affinity diagramming was use to analyze the majority of the
              qualitative data we collected, including behaviours, thoughts and
              opinions of our participants during user testing and answers from
              our post-test questionnaires. We started by transferring all main
              ideas onto sticky notes via FigJam and grouped them based on the
              type of issue being addressed. These types of issues were further
              grouped to show emergent themes such as "Navigation problems".
              Then one final grouping was done to reveal high-level themes that
              would inform us of key takeaways or large underlying issues that
              are consistent across the site.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Descriptive Statistics</h5>
            <p>
              Descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution plots were
              used to analyze Likert scale questions from the Post-Test
              Questionnaire. This helped visualize the spread of data for
              self-declared confidence ratings for ease-of-use, interface
              complexity, learnability, and good integration of functionality,
              which were used to supplement the findings from the Think-Aloud
              session and interview questions.

          <div>
            <h5>Discussions of Heuristic Evaluations</h5>
            <p>
              Group findings from the Heuristic Evaluation were analyzed through
              group discussion of individual findings and collective formation
              of severity ratings. Factors such as frequency, impact, and
              pervasiveness of each heuristic breach were considered when
              assigning severity ratings. Parallels were drawn with the key
              issues and themes identified from affinity diagramming and used in
              tandem to conclude which issues are truly relevant and problematic
              for our target users.

            <p>
              The first priority was restructuring Hoochy ‘Booch’s website to
              make it more efficient for users to complete browsing and
              purchasing flows. The team did this by simplifying the navigation
              bar, through eliminating the “Starter Kit” tab and “Our Kombucha”
              tab, its dropdowns “Flavours”, “Growler Program,” and “FAQ”. With
              the redesign, users can find all the products under “Shop” for
              specific products. They can also click “Shop” to go to the page
              that shows all their products in one place. This reduces the
              redundancy and confusion the navigation bar had previously.

              was no "Flavours" page where they could browse all the available
              flavours. With that on top of other issues with their current
              "Shop" page, we decided to completely redesign it. Major changes
              that were made were adding categories for the different products
              Hoochy 'Booch sells, adding additional information to each product
              listing, and clarifying CTA's to reduce user errors.

            <h5>Redesigned Product Pages (Efficiency)</h5>
            <p>
              Product pages were overhauled with an emphasis on clarity of
              information, and providing just enough information at first glance
              to help the user decide if the product is for them. Some major
              changes included moving the description of the flavour higher on
              the page, adding prices to the subscriptions so that the user can
              visually see how much money they would save by subscribing, and
              hiding secondary information in accordions to save vertical space
              on the page.

        <h1>Conclusion and Reflection</h1>
        <p>
          Through Heuristic Evaluation and Usability Testing, we identified
          issues with Hoochy 'Booch's website, including unclear information
          presentation causing user frustration. Usability test participants
          noted inconsistent flavors and frustrating interactions. We
          implemented various recommendations in a redesigned prototype,
          focusing on key pages impacting the user experience and business
          goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finalizing the prototype, a second round of Usability Testing
          with past participants yielded positive feedback. Users found the site
          clearer, appreciated the unified product display, and liked the
          improved homepage hero section with a "Shop" CTA. The redesigned
          product pages resolved confusion around growlers and the refill
          program, thanks to a new product name and an explanatory infographic.
        </p>
        <p>
          These changes enhance usability, user understanding, and overall
          browsing experience, ultimately driving increased online sales and
          subscriptions, aligning with Hoochy 'Booch's business goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back, I may have wanted to pay closer attention to when we
          decided to do heuristic evaluations. Conducting heuristic evaluations
          at the very beginning of our project allowed us an easy and cheap way
          of familiarizing ourselves with Hoochy Booch's website and brand.
          However it may introduced some bias into how we conducted usability
          testing and what problems we were able to find.
