This site is Chris Chan's personal portfolio page, it also serves as a place where I can upload data visualizations.

The page is hosted through Github Pages, you can visit the site at chaanchriis.github.io.
**The link to the visualizations page is in the footer of the homepage**

In this site I used HTML, CSS, SASS and Javascript
