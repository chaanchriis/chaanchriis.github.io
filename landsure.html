            I joined this project as the UX designer after research and meetings
            done by SurveyHub team determined that this feature was to be
            developed. I conducted interviews to understand user pain points,
            gave presentations to stakeholders and provided developers with

            new users very quickly figure out how to use it resulting decrease
            in time spent on pages where the feature was active.

        <h1>Problem with Current Implementation</h1>
        <p>
          Pilot users of SurveyHub forms reported that information retrieved
          from their myLTSA account was not always the correct information to
          auto-populate in the form because someone filling out a form might not
          always be filling it out for themselves, or they may work in different
          offices and require different autofill information. There was an ask
          from the users and a Jira ticket created for a customizable way to
          autofill information into forms. This is the point where I was asked
          to work on this project.

          Speaking to the project manager and UX designer on the SurveyHub
          project I was able to gather important information about the users and
          their pain points, as well as project goals.

          <h4>
            Pain Point: A lot of forms require the same blocks of information,
            annoying to need to fill it out over and over.

          <h4>
            Pain Point: Current Implementation of autofill does not work for me.

        <p>
          In a meeting with the developer, I was informed that forms on the
          back-end are built in “blocks” of data that make it easy for them to
          work with. These blocks of data were reflected in the UI of the forms
          as sections of form fields in a bounding box. This ended up being very
          important information because designing around this constraint
          strongly informed design choices down the line.

        <p>
          While working through the problems I had found, project requirements
          changed where instead of a full feature, an MVP was asked for instead
          because of low development capacity. Instead of working on a page to
          centrally manage the datablock templates within the account management
          of the site which would require developing a whole new webpage, I was
          asked to keep everything on the form page instead. I was also only
          required to make the BC Land Surveyor datablock work as a proof of
          concept which meant that I did not need to go through all of the
          different possible datablocks that forms could have. This required me
          to adapt some of my early designs. Mainly finding a way for users to
          manage their datablocks within the form page.

            The challenge of pivoting the scope and size of the project based on
            changing development capacity provided an opportunity for me to
            develop my adaptability and problem solving skills. Ensuring the
            work I had already done would not be wasted and could be repurposed
            within the new requirements of the project.

            Lesson: How if you are having issues with a lot of problems at once,
            if you solve one of them, or even just make a decision on something
            if its a close 50/50, it CAN help a lot with solving the rest of the
            issues. For example, when deciding between using nicknames for the
            templates or showing a preview, I was not really too sure because in
            my head, both options had its pros and cons. But I decided to go
            with the nicknames it also helped me decide to go with a list layout
            instead of a grid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lesson: You can help your users TOO MUCH as a designer, or at the
            very least, there is room for you to let your users figure it out
            themselves (trimmed down final version of modals)
          </p>
          <p>
            Lesson: Learning about how the back-end works and speaking to the
            developers can greatly inform the best ways for you to design
            something.
